## Kore

Kore is a low level toolkit for cross-platform game engine development and
similar endeavors. It is comparable to SDL but bigger in scope as it also
takes care of cross-platform GPU programming with multiple portable APIs
to choose from.

This is Kore's original C++-API which is now mapped to Kore 2's C-API
to provide convenient backwards-compatibility.
